  This tutorial will present some tips of how to learn Sencha Ext JS.

  I have been working with Ext JS for almost two years and I like it very much. That is why I decided to write this tutorial with some tips.



  



  Get to Know Sencha website:



  Sencha is the Ext SJ owner The current Ext JS version is 3.3. The version 4 is going to be released on February (with lots of fun new features).



  Sencha website is pretty complete. There are some tutorials (some os them are deprecated &#8211; but you can still read them and learn something from them), there are the offical forum (the development team and some ext js experts will answer your question), documentation, demos and samples and more. I recommend you to spend some time exploring it and of course bookmark it for future reference.


I am going to link some links I think it is important for you to get to know:

**_Mains ExtJS page_**: http://www.sencha.com/products/js/ &#8211; this is the Ext JS main page, use it as reference.

**_Samples and demos:_** http://www.sencha.com/products/js/ &#8211; this is the page I explore every week, looking for new components to learn. This page is really great. If you do not know how to get started with a component, use this page.

**_Documentation:_** http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/ &#8211; the documentation is great and the layout is very friendly, but it is only for online reference. If you need an offiline reference, please read this tutorial.

**_Tutorials:_** http://www.sencha.com/learn/Tutorials &#8211; this page is a little bit old, but you can get something from there.

**_Blog_** : http://www.sencha.com/blog/ &#8211; subscribe the feed, because this blog is great!

### Foruns:

English &#8211; Official: this is the official forum: http://www.sencha.com/forum/ Spanish: the Spanish community is very active: http://extjses.com/ Portuguese &#8211; Brazil: the Brazilian community is growing a lot: http://www.extjs.com.br/forum/

### Books:

There are a few book in the market about Ext JS, but they are fantastic! If you have the change to read all of them, please do it!

To get started I recommend: Learning Ext JS 3.2 and/or Ext JS in Action

If you have some experience &#8211; intermediate knowlegde: Ext JS 3.0 Cookbook

I have read all the three, the books are great and are worth buying them 

### Some other tips:


  Ext JS is a library with lots of features, and it is hard to get to know all the components at once. I recommend you to get started with the one you are going to use the most in your job and then you can study the others to boost your knowledge.



  The Sencha website provides you a great resource, but it is not enough to become a Ext JS master. I recommend you to read the books, because they are going to teach you everything you need to know &#8211; from basic to advanced techniques.



  Practice is the keyword. Practice, practice and practice. You will not learn if you only read tutorials and books. You need some hands on.



  I did a presentation at my work. It is an overview about Ext JS, if you are interested in the Ext JS features, please take a look:
