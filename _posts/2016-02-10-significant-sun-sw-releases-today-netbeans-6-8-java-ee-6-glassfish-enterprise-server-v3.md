    Support for New Specifications: New specifications are available including RESTful Web services, EJB 3.1 and EJB Lite, and Dependency Injection.
  
  
  
    Support for Profiles: Java EE 6 adds support for defining Profiles that may be a subset or superset of the traditional Java EE 6 full stack that are tailored to specific application scenarios or verticals.  One specific Profile is defined, the Web Profile, intended for the deployment of modern Web applications.
