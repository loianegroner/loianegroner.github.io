  Yesterday I made a presentation about ExtJS at IBM, for some co-workers.



  This presentation is the first one from a series about javascript frameworks. We&#8217;re also going to talk about JQuery and Dojo in next couple of months. This initiative it is called Technical Session, and Alberto Leal and I are the current leaders of this project at IBM Brazil &#8211; on the account we work on (US client).



  



  Well, I hope you like it:
