  This tutorial will walk you through how to set up Eclipse IDE for Ext JS and JQuery development with Spekt Eclipse plugin.



  I&#8217;ve been using Eclipse IDE since I started to play around with Java. Nowadays I use RAD (Rational Application Developer for professional development &#8211; Eclipse based &#8211; and Eclipse for my personal projects).



  Eclipse is great, and I what I like the most about it is the autocomplete feature. Unfortunately, it is available only for Java (or any other supported programming language), and if you work with web development, you probably also work with javaScript. And I miss the autocomplete feature for js files.



  But there is a solution for this case. You can use Spket Eclipse plugin. I&#8217;ve been using it for a couple of months and it is very good. It is saving me some time when I am coding.



  So I decided to write this tutorial. I hope it will be useful to you!
