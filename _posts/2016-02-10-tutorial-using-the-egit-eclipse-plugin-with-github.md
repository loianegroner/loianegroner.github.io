I started to use GitHub a couple of months ago.

I found this Elipse plugin â€“ EGit &#8211; and it did made my life so much easier (download projects from GitHub and upload projects &#8211; with may files &#8211; to GitHub). So I decided to write this tutorial, because I did not find any step by step Egit tutorial on the Internet


  What this tutorial covers:


  * Installing EGit
  * Importing an existing Eclipse project from Github
  * Uploading your Eclipse project to Github
  * Git operations from inside Eclipse


  Enjoy it and Happy coding!
