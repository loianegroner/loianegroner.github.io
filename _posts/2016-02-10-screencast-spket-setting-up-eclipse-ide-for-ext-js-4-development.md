This screencast will walk you through how to set up Eclipse IDE for Ext JS 4 development with Spekt Eclipse plugin. It demonstrates how to enable the autocomplete feature on Eclipse or Aptana

[I wrote a tutorial about it a while ago, but it demonstrates how to configure Spket with Ext JS 3][1]. This is an updated tutorial for Ext JS 4.




[Spket: Setting up Eclipse IDE for Ext JS 4 development][2] from [Loiane Groner][3] on [Vimeo][4].

This is a new category on my blog. On the next screencasts I will try to say something instead of writing! Hope you liked it!

Happy Coding!
