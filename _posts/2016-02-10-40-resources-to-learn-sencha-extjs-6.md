This is a list of 40+ resources to learn **Sencha ExtJS 6**. It contains presentations, tutorials, examples and best practices articles.

Right now I&#8217;m hosting this list in a Github repository. This way is easier in case you have a link or example that is not there and want to add it to the list (just make a pull request or open an issue).
