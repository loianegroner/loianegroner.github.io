**Ext JS 4** reorganized the API packages names and as a consequence, some classes has a new class name now. The **Ext JS 3** class names are still valid in **Ext JS 4**, but when we are **migrating** an app from **Ext JS 3** to **Ext JS 4**, it is recommended to change the class name as well.

[][1]

That being said, I created a simple application where you can quickly search for a **Ext JS 3** class name and find its correspondent **Ext JS 4** class name. _This application contains only the classes which name _have _ changed_.

I hope this can help someone.

And I am open for suggestions to improve this app.

Happy coding!
