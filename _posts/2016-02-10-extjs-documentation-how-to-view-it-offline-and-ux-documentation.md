  This post will walk you through how to view ExtJS documentation offline and also will present where you can view UX documentation.


### UX Documentation:


  Sencha provides a really good documentation about ExtJS. I like the style a lot. But sometimes I want to consult/view UX documentation and I do not know where to find it.



  Navigating through Sencha forum I found these two uris:


  * **ExtJS-UX**
  * **Sencha** &#8211; Official one

### How to use ExtJS docs offline?


  When you download ExtJS, there is a folder named &#8220;docs&#8220;. If you try to open index.html you will be able to navigate a little bit, but you will not be able to open a class or open its implementation.



  The first solution is to deploy the &#8220;docs&#8221; folder locally. The same applies to &#8220;examples&#8221; folder. Then you will be able to consult it offline.



  The second solution is to download ExtDocSuite.



  I use ExtDocSuite daily and I really like it, because it contains. The only thing I do not like about it is that I can not copy anything from the docs (method name, class name, etc). &#8211; Requires Adobe Air (so you will have to install it first).



  Following are some features:



  
    Includes the latest Documentation for ExtJS 3.3.0 (it updates automatically)
  
  
    Includes the latest ux Documentation from the examples/ folder (using ext-doc) &#8211; (really nice!)
  
  
    Includes the latest Ext.Air Documentation. (using ext-doc)
  
  
    Search works (online)
  
  
    EXPERIMENTAL per-class search aids in finding the right documentation in big classes
  
  
    Integrated Update-System so that your documentation always stays up to date (I really like this one!)
  


### How to install ExtDocSuite:


  1 &#8211; Open ExtDocSuite website and click on &#8220;Install now&#8221; on embedded installer



  



  2 &#8211; If you do not have Adobe Air installed, it will ask you to do it. If so, click on &#8220;Yes&#8221;



  



  3 &#8211; Wait while it installs Adobe Air&#8230;



  



  4 &#8211; System will display a popup. Just wait few seconds&#8230;



  



  5 &#8211; System will ask if you want to install ExtDocSuite. Click on &#8220;Install&#8221;



  



  6 &#8211; Choose location and click on &#8220;Continue&#8221;



  



  7 &#8211; Click on &#8220;Agree&#8221;



  



  8 &#8211; Wait few seconds while it is installing ExtDocSuite.



  



  9 &#8211; Done! You can start using ExtDocSuite.



  



  10 &#8211; Obs.: if embebed installer fails, try the direct download. The installion process is the same as listed above.



  


Happy Coding!
