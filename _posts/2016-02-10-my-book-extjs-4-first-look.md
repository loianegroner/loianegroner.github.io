  Hi folks,



  I&#8217;m very happy to announce that my book: ExtJS 4 First Look is released for pre order now.



  The book is going to be out in November/2011. Currently is in review phase and I think they are going to release the RAW as well.



  



  I&#8217;ve been working on this book since March, when Sencha released the Ext 4 preview version. If you follow me on twitter or follow the updates on my blog, you know I am in love with Ext JS.



  This book has been a challenge for me, first because it is a book, it is huge deal; second because it is something new on the market (ExtJS has been on the market for a few years, but there is a lot of new cool features in Ext4), so I am studying a lot all these new features and third because I wrote the book in English, which is not my first language (I&#8217;m from Brazil, so my mother language is Portuguese-Brazil) . But so far did not get any complain from the editors about English errors (which is a big Yay for me!).



  In my family, I&#8217;m part of the first generation that could go to college, so writing and publising a book in a foreign language is a super ultra mega huge deal, and my parents are very very proud. So is my husband, who was/is really patient through out all this process.



  I also would like to thank everyone for the support and ideas for the book! Thank you very much! 



  Well, about the book: this is a book for developers who already know some Ext JS. This book highlights the new features from Ext JS 4, there are some example comparing how something was done in Ext 3 and how you should do in Ext 4. So if you do not have any knowledge about Ext JS, this is not the book for you.



  The book is driven by examples. So to explain something, I present an example and a screenshot of the output of the code and then I explain what the code does. It is pretty much what I usually do here on my blog, but with more details.



  I put so much work and love in this book and I hope you enjoy it. I can&#8217;t wait November to have a print edition on my hands!

  Happy Coding!



  Update &#8211; January 2012:


For all people asking me when the book is going to be available: I got in touch with someone from Packt and they said to me they had an internal problema with the release of some books, including mine. Their answer is that the book is going to be published this month (January 2012 &#8211; I do not have the exact date). I apologize to everyone that already bought the book and did not get it yet.

But you have to understand that I am just the author of the book, I do not control the publishing process, these things are not up to me. I am also really hoping that this book is going to be published soon.
