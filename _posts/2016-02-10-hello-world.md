  After almost a year writing in my blog in Portuguese, I decided to start a new one in English.



  I&#8217;m going to start translating some of my posts, and maybe I can write some exclusive ones in the future.



  I&#8217;m not fluent in English, but I&#8217;ll give my best. Feel free to give me some tips to improve my proficiency in English. I will appreciate it.



  This blog it&#8217;s an excuse for me to study and learn more about technologies and the English language. It is kind a log of everything I study (personal and work stuff).



  Here, you will find some Java and related technologies tutorials, including some javascript libraries tutorials, such as Ext JS and JQuery, and other stuff.



  Well, good luck for me and happy coding!
