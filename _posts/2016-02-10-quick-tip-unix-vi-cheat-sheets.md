Earlier this week, I started to play around **Unix/Aix**. I have to confess: I was very confused with all those commands that are anything intuitive.

I was looking like those people that have never turned a computer on before, and you have to teach them how to use a mouse and how to move the cursor around the screen. Totally newbie.

I definitely need those cheat sheets I can reference when I&#8217;m working on the command line environment.

So I goggled it and I found some interesting cheat sheets/ref cards. Following are some links that helped me (in case you need it as well):
