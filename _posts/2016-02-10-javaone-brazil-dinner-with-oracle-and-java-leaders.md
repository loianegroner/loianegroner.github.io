  Yesterday I had the opportunity to have dinner with some Oracle fellows (Java, Netbeans, Glassfish evangelists) and some Java Leaders in a pizza bar in Sao Paulo &#8211; Brazil. JavaOne Brazil is starting today.



  



  It was really nice and we had to much pizza. We talked about Java, Oracle and we also talked about movies, relationships, barbecuing, embarrassing moments in our lives. It was nice to know the other side of Java experts.



  I also had the pleasure to meet Nichole, from JUG Leaders mailing list. She is really nice (and pretty! :)).

  Oracle also published a blog entry on its blog: http://blogs.oracle.com/java/2010/12/javaone_latin_america_underway.html



  I will write a JavaOne Brazil + Oracle Open World review on next posts.



  See ya!
