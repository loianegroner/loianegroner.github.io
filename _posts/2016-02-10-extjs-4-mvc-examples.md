I&#8217;ve been away from this blog a little while, but I am back! 

To start again my blog post series, I am going to start porting the Sencha ExtJS 4 examples into the MVC architecture.


     


I&#8217;ve been publishing a series of free trainings of ExtJS 4, Sass and Compass and Sencha Touch 2 in my Portuguese blog. If you speak Portuguese or Spanish, you can try to understand them! When I have some time, I will record the same videos in English too.

I am going to publish an example per week, so feel free to follow this posts updates.
