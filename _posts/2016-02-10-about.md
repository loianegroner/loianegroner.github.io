  Very Short Bio



  Hi, my name is Loiane Groner, I&#8217;m from Brazil, 24 years old, nerd/geek, and I live in Campinas &#8211; SÃ£o Paulo &#8211; Brazil.



  I work as Java Developer/IT Specialist/Systems Analyst at IBM Brazil and I am also a team leader.



  I&#8217;m IBM Academic Initiative Ambassador (volunteer) and I coordinate two brazilian JUGs:


&#8211; ESJUG: Espirito Santo Java Users Group coordinator
  
&#8211; CampinasJUG: Campinas Java Users Group Leader/Coordinator


  I love technology, programming, math and to study.



  In my free time I like to play with my dog (pomeranian puppy), watch TV series, play videogames and to travel.


**About this Blog**


  This blog is a LOG of everything I&#8217;m learning and things I judge that are important to me. I like to write tutorials, so in the future I can go back here and remember whatever I need to. As I already said, I&#8217;m Brazilian, and I am not fluent in English. This blog is also an opportunity to improve my English skills. Feel free to leave a comment or correct me! I love to learn new things, let&#8217;s share knowledge!
