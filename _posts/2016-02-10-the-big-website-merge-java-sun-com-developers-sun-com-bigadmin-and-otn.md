This is the email Oracle sent to JUG Leaders mailing-list:


  


> JUG Leaders, Java Champions:
> 
> You may have noted the reference to a planned Website integration in the FAQ that was published just at Sun/Oracle change-in-control. After months of work and planning by some of the same people who have run these sites for years, this project is at hand: On July 19, developers.sun.com, java.sun.com, BigAdmin, and Oracle Technology Network will become one (under oracle.com/technetwork). Because of your importance in the community, you are the first people to be notified about this news, and we encourage you to share it with your members/peers.
> 
> We have tried to anticipate major questions in the new FAQ published here. But before you get that far, I want to assure you of some very important things in relation to java.sun.com:
> 
> &#8211; All non-obsolete content will be migrated (yes, a clean-up was done), and when possible, original information architecture will be preserved.
  
> &#8211; Although URLs will change, we will implement 1:1 redirects for the most popular/important content from the migrated sites &#8211; including the Java APIs. Your bookmarks won&#8217;t break.
  
> &#8211; Java developers will continue to have their own &#8220;place&#8221; in the framework (atoracle.com/technetwork/java), just as they did under java.sun.com, and the content there will continue to be Technology-focused (not product-focused).
  
> &#8211; Ultimately, I think you&#8217;ll find the approach similar to that of developers.sun.com.
> 
> I encourage you to read the FAQ for more information, and if you have comments or feedback, to provide it via this list or to me directly.
> 
> We are going to do everything we can to make this integration as seamless as possible, but the reality is that this project is large and complex; so you may encounter some challenges on the first day. However we’ll make incremental improvements quickly, and we need your help and feedback to do that.
