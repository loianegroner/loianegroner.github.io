I saw this book at amazon.com in December 2010 and I decided to buy it. As I live in Brazil, it is going to take a while until I have it in my hands (~2 months &#8211; we do not have the 2 days shipment &#8211; there is another shipment option, but it is very expensive). So, when I get the book, I am going to write a book review about it and post it here.

I still do not know if it is worth of buying. The resources most used for people to practice for the java certification are Whizlabs and TestKiller. We did not have any official book about it. So I am going to find out if is good in a month! 

I bought it for 19 dolars on amazon.com; On McGraw-hill webiste is 35 dolars:
