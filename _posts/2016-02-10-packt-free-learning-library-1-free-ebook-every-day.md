Since last month, Packt Publishing will be throwing open the virtual doors of its new Free Learning Library and offering its customers a daily chance to grab a fresh free eBook from its website. The publisher is encouraging people to learn new skills and try out new technologies and so every day it will be offering a different eBook from its huge list of titles free for anyone to download.
  
The Free Learning Library will be open year-round but each title will only be up for 24 hours, so make sure you keep checking back to get your hands on the latest book! Packt has well over 2000 titles published and the range of topics that could potentially feature is huge. From AngularJS to Zabbix, there&#8217;s going to be something to appeal to everyone &#8211; this is a great opportunity to try out a different technology or a new technique.
  
All you&#8217;ll have to do is simply click on the day’s free eBook and it will instantly be added to your account. New customers are also encouraged to take advantage, with the offer being a brilliant chance to try out Packt&#8217;s great range of books and products – all that’s required is a Packt account.
